## Our Project
At the Night at the Museum, we got to present our project as well as see what other people accomplished this trimester. Our project was a Diagnosis System; it allowed users to select the symptoms they had and get a diagnosis, treatment advice, and additional information after clicking a single button. 

Here are some photos of our own exhibit.

## Other Exhibits
In addition to our own exhibit, many other classes were displaying the work they completed this trimester. These classes include 3D Animation, ceramics, and drawing and painting.

Here are some really interesting ceramic pieces that we saw. We all thought that the art was very unique and fun. There were many different forms for the ceramic projects including animals, cups, buildings, and even food.
