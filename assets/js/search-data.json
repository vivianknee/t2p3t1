            "content": "Variables . A variable is an abstraction inside a program that can hold a value | It organizes data by labeling it with a descriptive name | It consists of three parts: name, value, and type | Using meaningful variables names helps with readability of program code and understanding of what values are represented by the variables | . Naming Variables . Do&#39;s Don&#39;ts Why . highScore | highestScoreInTheGame | Keep it simple and easy to read, having variables that are too complicated can cause your code to become messy later on | . highScore | highscore | Differentiate the words in your variable with a capital letter. Makes things easier to read | . firstName | n | not specific enough/vague | . isRaining | is it raining | spaces are improper syntax | . phoneNumber | 555-number | dashes are improper syntax and numbers should be avoided in variable names | . Types of data Integer: A number | Text/string: A word | Boolean: Data that determines if something is true or false | . | . name = &quot;table1&quot; #string print(name, type(name)) number = 4 #integer print(number, type(number)) isAbsent = False print(isAbsent, type(isAbsent)) . table1 &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; 4 &lt;class &#39;int&#39;&gt; False &lt;class &#39;bool&#39;&gt; . A list of data can also be stored in variables. Why is that useful? . print/retrieve specific values in the list without creating a lot of variables | easily remove/add/change items into the list | . colors = [&quot;red&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;] print(colors[2]) . yellow . Assignments . The assignment operator allows a program to change the value represented by a variable | Used to assigning values to variables | . Operator Description Syntax Outcome when print(a) . = | Assign value of right side of expression to left side operand | a = b | b | . += | Add right side operand with left side operand and then assign to left operand | a += b | a + b | . -= | Subtract right operand from left operand and then assign to left operand: True if both operands are equal | a -= b | a - b | . *= | Multiply right operand with left operand and then assign to left operand | a *= b | a * b | . /= | Divide left operand with right operand and then assign to left operand | a /= b | a / b | . **= | Calculate exponent(raise power) value using operands and assign value to left operand | a **= b | a ^ b | . a = 1 b = 2 a = b print(a) . The value stored in a variable will be the most recent value assigned . a = 1 b = a a = 2 print(b) . 1 . Changing Values . currentScore = 10 highScore = currentScore currentScore = 7 print(highScore) . your turn! Here are 3 problems for you to solve . num1 = 5 num2 = 9 num1 = num2 print(num1) print(num2) . num1 = 15 num2 = 25 num3 = 42 num2 = num3 num3 = num1 num1 = num2 print(num1) print(num2) print(num3) . Which of these will show the sum? . num2 += num1 print(num1) print(num2) print(str(num1)+ str(num2)) print(num1 + num2) . Data Abstraction . Method used in coding to represent data in a useful form, by taking away aspects of data that aren&#39;t being used in the situation | Variables and lists are primary tools in data abstraction | Provides a separation between the abstract properties of a data type and the concrete details of its representation | . Lists &amp; Strings . List = ordered sequence of elements | Element = individual value in a list that is assigned to a unique index | Index = a way to reference the elements in a list or string using natural numbers; each element of a string is referenced by an index | String = ordered sequence of characters (Letters, numbers, special characters) . Note: index starts at 1 for AP Exam, must be whole numbers, cannot be negative, and goes up to the number of elements in the list We can represent a list or string using a variable . | . Example of a List - Colors . Index Element . 1 | Green | . 2 | Blue | . 3 | Purple | . 4 | Pink | . At Index 1, the element is green, at index 2, the element is blue, etc. | . Managing the Complexity of a Program through Data Abstraction . Data abstractions help manage complexity in programs by giving a collection of data a name without referencing the specific details of the representation | Developing a data abstraction to use in a program can result in a program that is easier to develop and maintain | . Using Lists as Data Abstractions . What are Lists? . Allow for data abstraction | Bundle variables together | Store multiple elements | Allows multiple related items to be treated as a single value | Give one name to a set of memory cells | Can keep adding elements to it as needed | Can store elements as a single variable by using a list | . 3 Types of List Operations . Assigning values to a list at certain indices | Creating an empty list and assigning it to a variable | Assigning a copy of one list to another list (setting one list equal to another list) | 1. Assigning values to a list at certain indices . colorsList=[&quot;pink&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;] print(colorsList) . [&#39;pink&#39;, &#39;yellow&#39;, &#39;green&#39;, &#39;blue&#39;, &#39;orange&#39;] . 2. Creating an empty list and assigning it to a variable . colorsList=[] # can be used if you want to create a list that can be filled with values later . 3. Assigning a copy of one list to another list (setting one list equal to another list) . # copy of the list is made; the list isn&#39;t sorted in place def Reverse(lst): # defining variable: lst new_lst = lst[::-1] return new_lst lst = [&quot;pink&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;purple&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;black&quot;] print(Reverse(lst)) # reverse 1st . [&#39;black&#39;, &#39;blue&#39;, &#39;orange&#39;, &#39;yellow&#39;, &#39;purple&#39;, &#39;green&#39;, &#39;pink&#39;] . What is Managing Complexity? . Improving code readability | Reducing the need for new variables as more data is collected | Can easily update data | Can easily convert data to different forms | . How do Lists Help Manage the Complexity of a Program? . Don’t need as many variables | Can easily change the number of variables | Can apply the same mathematical computation (through an algorithm) to all the elements in the list | . Data Abstraction Practice . Manage the complexity of the given code below using a list. Re-write the code segment in a less complex way, but with the same result. . color1=&quot;green&quot; color2=&quot;red&quot; color3=&quot;pink&quot; color4=&quot;purple&quot; color5=&quot;blue&quot; color6=&quot;brown&quot; print(color1) print(color2) print(color3) print(color4) print(color5) print(color6) . green red pink purple blue brown . Answer . colorList=[&quot;green&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, &quot;pink&quot;, &quot;purple&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;, &quot;brown&quot;] print(str(colorList)) . [&#39;green&#39;, &#39;red&#39;, &#39;pink&#39;, &#39;purple&#39;, &#39;blue&#39;, &#39;brown&#39;] . AP Exam Use of Data Abstraction . With the properties of the AP Exam pseudocode, lists work differently from what we&#39;ve learned in python so far, here are the two major differences: . The index does not start at 0 but 1 | There is only one method of interchanging data between lists, and that is completely overwriting previous list data with the other list n&quot;, | . Homework . You will turn in a program that utilizes lists and variables as it&#39;s primary function, options could be a quiz, a sorter, database, or wherever your imagination brings you. You will be graded on how well you understood the concepts and if you used anything other than just the simplest parts . Quiz template, if you do use it, fix the issues, and add more to it than it&#39;s current barebones state. I would recommend using it to create something related to school. . quesCount = 0 # Use a dictionary for the questions quesList = [&quot;Question1&quot;, &quot;Question2&quot;, &quot;Question3&quot;, &quot;Question4&quot;] # Use a dictionary for the correct solutions soluList = [&quot;Solution1&quot;, &quot;Solution2&quot;, &quot;Solution3&quot;, &quot;Solution4&quot;] quesAmount= len(quesList) hrm quesCount &lt;= quesAmount: print(quesList[quescount] + &quot; n&quot;) guess = input() if(guess == soluList[quesamOOuaunt]): score+=1 print(&quot;Correct! Score: &quot;) else: print(&quot;Incorrect! The correct answer was &quot; + soluList(quescount) + &quot; n&quot;) quesCount += 1 print(&quot;Final score: &quot; + str(score)) .
