            "content": "Variables . A variable is an abstraction inside a program that can hold a value | It organizes data by labeling it with a descriptive name | It consists of three parts: name, value, and type | Types of data Integer: A number | Text/string: A word | Boolean: Data that determines if something is true or false | . | . name = &quot;table1&quot; #string print(name, type(name)) number = 4 #integer print(number, type(number)) isAbsent = False print(isAbsent, type(isAbsent)) . vivian &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; 4 &lt;class &#39;int&#39;&gt; False &lt;class &#39;bool&#39;&gt; . A list of data can also be stored in variables. Why is that useful? . print/retrieve specific values in the list without creating a lot of variables | easily remove/add/change items into the list (get into this soon) | . colors = [&quot;red&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;] print(colors[2]) . [&#39;red&#39;, &#39;orange&#39;, &#39;yellow&#39;] . Assignments . The assignment operator allows a program to change the value represented by a variable | remove/add/change items into the list | . The value stored in a variable will be the most recent value assigned . a = 1 b = a a = 2 print(b) . 1 . Changing Values . currentScore = 10 highScore = currentScore currentScore = 7 print(highScore) . 10 . your turn! . num1 = 5 num2 = 9 num1 = num2 print(num1) print(num2) . Data Abstraction .",
