            "content": "Variables . A variable is an abstraction inside a program that can hold a value | It organizes data by labeling it with a descriptive name | It consists of three parts: name, value, and type | Using meaningful variables names helps with readability of program code and understanding of what values are represented by the variables | . Naming Variables . Do&#39;s Don&#39;ts Why . highScore | highestScoreInTheGame | Keep it simple and easy to read, having variables that are too complicated can cause your code to become messy later on | . highScore | highscore | Differentiate the words in your variable with a capital letter. Makes things easier to read | . firstName | n | not specific enough/vague | . isRaining | is it raining | spaces are improper syntax | . phoneNumber | 555-number | dashes are improper syntax and numbers should be avoided in variable names | . Types of data Integer: A number | Text/string: A word | Boolean: Data that determines if something is true or false | . | . name = &quot;table1&quot; #string print(name, type(name)) number = 4 #integer print(number, type(number)) isAbsent = False print(isAbsent, type(isAbsent)) . table1 &lt;class &#39;str&#39;&gt; 4 &lt;class &#39;int&#39;&gt; False &lt;class &#39;bool&#39;&gt; . A list of data can also be stored in variables. Why is that useful? . print/retrieve specific values in the list without creating a lot of variables | easily remove/add/change items into the list | . colors = [&quot;red&quot;, &quot;orange&quot;, &quot;yellow&quot;] print(colors[2]) . yellow . Assignments . The assignment operator allows a program to change the value represented by a variable | Used to assigning values to variables | . Operator Description Syntax Outcome when print(a) . = | Assign value of right side of expression to left side operand | a = b | b | . += | Add right side operand with left side operand and then assign to left operand | a += b | a + b | . -= | Subtract right operand from left operand and then assign to left operand: True if both operands are equal | a -= b | a - b | . *= | Multiply right operand with left operand and then assign to left operand | a *= b | a * b | . /= | Divide left operand with right operand and then assign to left operand | a /= b | a / b | . **= | Calculate exponent(raise power) value using operands and assign value to left operand | a **= b | a ^ b | . a = 1 b = 2 a = b print(a) . The value stored in a variable will be the most recent value assigned . a = 1 b = a a = 2 print(b) . 1 . Changing Values . currentScore = 10 highScore = currentScore currentScore = 7 print(highScore) . your turn! Here are 2 problems for you to solve . num1 = 5 num2 = 9 num1 = num2 print(num1) print(num2) . num1 = 15 num2 = 25 num3 = 42 num2 = num3 num3 = num1 num1 = num2 print(num1) print(num2) print(num3) .
